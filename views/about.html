                    <p>Salvador Dalí was born on 11 May 1904. Dalí attended the Municipal Drawing School at Figueres from 1916 
                        and also discovered modern painting on a summer vacation trip to Cadaqués with the family of Ramon Pichot, 
                        a local artist who made regular trips to Paris. He had his first public exhibition at the Municipal Theatre 
                        in Figueres in 1918,[25] a site he would return to decades later. In early 1921 the Pichot family introduced 
                        Dalí to Futurism and Dalí's uncle Anselm Domenech, who owned a bookshop in Barcelona, supplied him with books 
                        and magazines on Cubism and contemporary art.</p>

                    <p>In 1922, Dalí moved into the Residencia de Estudiantes (Students' Residence) in Madrid and studied at the Real 
                Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando. At the Residencia, he became close friends with Pepín Bello, Luis Buñuel, 
                Federico García Lorca, and others associated with the Madrid avant-garde group Ultra. In April 1926 Dalí made his 
                first trip to Paris where he met Pablo Picasso, whom he revered. That year, Dalí left the Royal Academy in 1926, 
                shortly before his final exams. From 1927 Dalí's work became increasingly influenced by Surrealism. Influenced by his 
                reading of Freud, Dalí increasingly introduced suggestive sexual imagery and symbolism into his work.</p>

                    <p>In 1929, Dalí collaborated with Surrealist film director Luis Buñuel on the short film Un Chien Andalou (An Andalusian Dog). 
                His main contribution was to help Buñuel write the script for the film. In August 1929, Dalí met his lifelong muse and future wife Gala, 
                born Elena Ivanovna Diakonova. She was a Russian immigrant ten years his senior, who at that time was married to Surrealist poet Paul Éluard. 
                In works such as The First Days of Spring, The Great Masturbator and The Lugubrious Game Dalí continued his exploration of the themes of sexual 
                anxiety and unconscious desires. In 1931, Dalí painted one of his most famous works, The Persistence of Memory,[63] which developed a surrealistic 
                image of soft, melting pocket watches. The general interpretation of the work is that the soft watches are a rejection of the assumption that 
                time is rigid or deterministic. Dalí and Gala, having lived together since 1929, were civilly married on 30 January 1934 in Paris. 
                In addition to inspiring many artworks throughout her life, Gala would act as Dalí's business manager.</p>

                    <p>In 1948 Dalí and Gala moved back into their house in Port Lligat, on the coast near Cadaqués. For the next three decades they would 
                spend most of their time there, spending winters in Paris and New York. Dalí 's decision to live in Spain under Franco and his public
                support for the regime prompted outrage from many anti-Francoist artists and intellectuals. Pablo Picasso refused to mention Dalí's 
                name or acknowledge his existence for the rest of his life. Dalí had been extensively using optical illusions such as double images, 
                anamorphosis, negative space, visual puns and trompe-l'œil since his Surrealist period and this continued in his later work. In 1960, 
                Dalí began work on his Theatre-Museum in his home town of Figueres. It was his largest single project and a main focus of his energy 
                through to 1974, when it opened. He continued to make additions through the mid-1980s.</p>

                    <p>In 1980, at age 76, Dalí's health deteriorated sharply and he was treated for depression, drug addiction and Parkinson-like symptoms, 
                including a severe tremor in his right arm. There were also allegations that Gala had been supplying Dalí with pharmaceuticals from 
                her own prescriptions. Gala died on 10 June 1982, at the age of 87. After her death, on 23 January 1989, while his favorite record of 
                Tristan and Isolde played, Dalí died of heart failure at the age of 84.</p>
